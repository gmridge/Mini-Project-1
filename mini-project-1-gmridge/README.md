## â–ª What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?

```
I wanted to create something fun, useful and community building. The topic of new year resolutions is currently popular with my friends and I wanted to combine accountability with entertainment.

I researched other websites like 'GoodReads.com' and 'NYTimes.com/books' to see popular articles and what the reading community was interested in as I knew I wanted to create a homepage showcases other resources.
```

</br>

## â–ª Give a high level overview of your application and its features.

```
Features:

Reading Goal Setting: Users can set a reading goal by inputting the desired number of books they aim to read into the "Reading Goal" input field. Upon clicking the "Set Goal" button, the application stores this goal.

Book Search: Users can search for books by title using the search bar provided. When they enter a query and click the "Search" button, the application fetches book data from the Open Library API and displays the top two search results. Each result includes the book's title, author, cover image, and an "Add to List" button.

Add to List: Users can add books from the search results to their reading list by clicking the "Add to List" button associated with each book. Upon clicking, the book's title, author, and cover image are appended to the "BookShelf" section of the page. Additionally, the application increments the reading count and updates the "Books Read" counter in the footer.

Reading Goal Celebration: If the user reaches their reading goal, the application triggers a celebration by displaying fireworks and a "READING GOAL ACHIEVED!" message.

Sorting: Users can sort their saved book list alphabetically, by year released, or by genre using the dropdown menu provided. The application dynamically reorders the book list based on the selected sorting criteria.

Technologies:

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the Bootstrap framework for responsive design and utilizes the Fetch API to interact with the Open Library API for book data retrieval. Additionally, it includes jQuery and Bootstrap JavaScript libraries for enhanced functionality and styling.

Overall, BookGrub provides users with a simple yet effective way to manage their reading goals and organize their reading lists in a visually appealing interface.

## â–ª Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?

```
external API:
https://openlibrary.org/
```

</br>

## â–ª How is this data processed and displayed?

```
Set reading goals, search for books, and organize their reading lists. Users can input a reading goal and search for books by title, with the top two results displayed, including book details and an "Add to List" button. Books added to the reading list are dynamically displayed, and users can sort their saved book list alphabetically, by year released, or by genre for better organization and tracking of their reading progress.
```

</br>

## â–ª How can the user interact with your Application?

```
Through the provided web interface. 
```

</br>

## â–ª What JS/TS techniques have you used ?

_(eg. objects/arrays/DOMfunctions/loops/functions/ifs)_

```
DOM Manipulations / Fetch API / Functions / Loops / Conditional Statements / Arrays / Parsing / Template Literals
```

</br>

## â–ª What external tools/libraries have you used? How? Why?

_(eg. bootstrap/axios/charts)_

</br>

## â–ª How might you extend the features of your application in future?

```
I would love to have share options to be able to share your library with friends, or even a tracking feature to show how close your friends are to their goal.
A review and rating option would be great and i'd also love to build a browse-able bookshelf in React.
